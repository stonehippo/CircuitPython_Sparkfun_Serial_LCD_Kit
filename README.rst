Introduction
============

This driver is for the `Sparkfun Serial LCD Kit <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10097>`_. It provides an API for the full set of `byte-based commands that control the backpack <https://github.com/jimblom/Serial-LCD-Kit/wiki/Serial-Enabled-LCD-Kit-Datasheet>`_.

Dependencies
============

This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============

The ``SerialLCDKit`` class sends text and special command bytes to the backpack controller via a UART.

.. code-block:: python

  import board
  import busio
  import serial_lcd_kit

  uart = busio.UART(board.TX, board.RX, baudrate=9600)
  lcd = serial_lcd_kit.SerialLCDKit(uart)

  lcd.write("Hello, world!")


If your board has ``board.UART`` defined you can make this simpler with something like this

.. code-block:: python

  import board
  import serial_lcd_kit
  
  lcd = serial_lcd_kit.SerialLCDKit(board.UART())

The ``BaudRate`` class defines constants for valid baud rates to set on the serial interface for the backpack controller

.. code-block:: python

  import board
  import busio
  import serial_lcd_kit

  uart = busio.UART(board.TX, board.RX, baudrate=9600)
  lcd = serial_lcd_kit.SerialLCDKit(uart)

  # set the new baud rate to 115,200 bps, which will be stored in EEPROM
  lcd.set_baud_rate(serial_lcd_kit.BaudRate.BAUD_RATE_115200)

Note: I have found that tryting to use a baud of 300 BPS with some boards (e.g. Metro M0) does not work. I cannot imagine why you'd want to talk to the LCD that slowly with anything modern anyway!

If you need to change the UART of your CircuitPython board directly (for example, if the backpack baud is not the defualt 9600), you can use something like

.. code-block:: python
    
    lcd._uart.baudrate = 115200
